### UX Research: Right-Handed Ergonomics

**Critical Statistics:**
- 📊 **90% of users are right-handed**
- 🎯 **Mouse Movement Patterns**: Right-handed users naturally move from center (chart) to right (actions)
- ⚡ **Reduced Cursor Travel**: Minimizes distance for primary trading actions
- 🧠 **Cognitive Flow**: Left-to-right information processing → right-side action

**Optimal Trading Workflow:**
1. **Chart Analysis** (Center focus - dominant visual area)
2. **Data Review** (Secondary information - left sidebar)  
3. **Trade Execution** (Primary action - right-accessible for 90% of users)

## Implementation: SOTA Layout Optimization

### Before (Sub-optimal for Right-Handed Users):
```
Trading Form (Left 300px) | Chart (Center 1fr) | Data Sidebar (Right 350px)
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Forces right-handed users to move cursor LEFT for primary actions
- ❌ Increases cognitive load and execution time
- ❌ Goes against natural reading/action flow (left-to-right → right-action)
- ❌ Counter to industry standards (Hyperliquid, Binance Pro)

### After (Right-Handed Optimized - SOTA):
```
Portfolio & Positions (Left 350px) | Market Data & Chart (Center 1fr) | Trading Form (Right 300px)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Ergonomic Optimization**: Natural right-hand mouse movement from chart to trading form
- ✅ **Reduced Cursor Travel**: Minimizes distance for primary trading actions  
- ✅ **Industry Alignment**: Matches Hyperliquid and advanced Binance layouts
- ✅ **Cognitive Flow**: Left-to-right information processing → right-side action
- ✅ **Execution Efficiency**: Faster order placement for 90% of users
